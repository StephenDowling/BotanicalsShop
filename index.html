                        <h3>Plants may help reduce stress levels</h3>
                        <p>A study published in the Journal of Physiological Anthropology found that plants in your home or office can make you feel more comfortable, soothed, and natural. In the study, participants were given two different tasks: repotting a houseplant or completing a short computer-based task. After each task, researchers measured the biological factors associated with stress, including heart rate and blood pressure. They found that the indoor gardening task lowered the stress response in participants. The computer task, on the other hand, caused a spike in heart rate and blood pressure, even though the study participants were young men well-accustomed to computerized work. Researchers concluded that working with plants could reduce both physiological and psychological stress.</p>
                        <h3>Working with plants can be therapeutic</h3>
                        <p>For people experiencing the symptoms of mental illness, indoor gardening can be helpful. Researchers have used horticultural therapy to increase feelings of well-being among people with depression, anxiety, dementia, and other conditions. Although horticultural therapy has been around for centuries, it has found a modern expression: Medical clinics in Manchester, England are now "prescribing" potted plants to patients with depression or anxiety symptoms.</p>

                        <h3>Plants may help you recover from illness faster</h3>
                        <p>Being able to look at plants and flowers may speed your recovery from an illness, injury, or surgery. A 2002 review of the research revealed that people recuperating from several kinds of surgery needed less pain medication and had shorter hospital stays than people who weren't looking at greenery during their recovery periods. It's important to note that most research focuses on plants and natural scenery in hospital settings rather than at home.</p>
                        <h3>Real plants may sharpen your attention</h3>
                        <p>Sorry, plastic plants won't help you pass your exams. In a small study involving 23 participants, researchers put students in a classroom with either a fake plant, a real one, a photograph of a plant, or no plant at all. Brain scans of the participants showed that the students who studied with real, live plants in the classroom were more attentive and better able to concentrate than students in the other groups</p>

                    <h3>Neem (Azadirachta Indica)</h3>
                    <p>Neem (also called nim or margosa), is a fast-growing tree of the mahogany family (Meliaceae), valued as a medicinal plant, as a source of organic pesticides, and for its timber. Neem trees can reach 15-30 metres (49-98 feet) in height and have attractive rounded crowns and thick furrowed bark. Neem is usually grown from seed but can be propagated from cuttings or root suckers. The plant is hardy and resilient and grows well in poor, rocky soils. Neem trees require plenty of sunlight. The trees benefit from regular moisture, but be careful not to overwater, as the tree won't tolerate wet feet or poorly drained soil. Allow the soil to dry between every watering.</p>
                    <h3>Yucca (Yucca Elephantipes)</h3>
                    <p>Growing up to 12 m in height, it is an evergreen shrub often referred to simply as yucca cane. The Yucca plant is one garden plant which will be quite happy with as much sun as you can give it. Less bright conditions will slow growth considerably. Water your Yucca liberally during warmer months of the year.The soil should dry out a little between watering's. In Winter a lot less water is required.</p>
                    <h3>Swiss Cheese Plant (Monstera Deliciosa)</h3>
                    <p>The Swiss cheese plant gets its common name from its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop holes as the plant ages (in a process called fenestration). Because of the Swiss cheese plant's tropical origin, it needs sunlight, but it's best if the light is bright and indirect. These plants like to be consistently moist but not soaked. Providing regular water and food will be your main care task with this plant. You also might need to do some maintenance pruning to keep the plant at your desired size. <u>It's important to note that all parts of Monstera plants are toxic to pets.</u></p>
                    <h3>Bonsai (Acer Palmatum)</h3>
                    <p>The Japanese Maple, otherwise known as Acer palmatum, is originally from Japan, China, and Korea. It owes its botanical name to the hand-shaped leaves with five pointed lobes. Japanese Maple Bonsai do really well in sunny and airy locations, but when temperatures rise to 30°C (85°F) or above, it should be placed somewhere with indirect sunlight to prevent the sun from damaging the leaves. A Japanese Maple Bonsai must be watered daily during the growing season. During the hotter days in the growing season, it's sometimes necessary to water your tree several times, if the soil is well-drained and the tree is healthy and vigorous.</p>

                    <h3>Areca Palm (Dypsis Lutescens)</h3>
                    <p>The Areca Palm or Butterfly Palm is a relatively easy care indoor houseplant that has much going for it. Its attractive nature has been awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Areca Palm's will accept a spot which doesn't receive any sunlight at all during the day and equally it will accept direct sun, however it doesn't like excessive amounts of either. Natively Areca Palms come from the tropics so they're used to regular daily tropical showers and having their roots in constantly damp soil. With this in mind the ideal watering requirements would be to ensure the soil is moist for much of the time.</p>
                    <h3>Croton (Codiaeum Variegatum)</h3>
                    <p>Croton (Codiaeum variegatum) are beautiful house plants, grown for their bold and striking foliage. They're also known as Joseph's coat as their thick, oval, pointed leaves are splashed with many colours, including red, pink, burgundy, orange, yellow and green. Crotons need plenty of bright light, a consistently warm spot and high humidity. They can take some direct sunshine but keep them away from direct midday sun. Keep the soil moist from spring to autumn, and provide some humidity by misting regularly or standing on a tray of moist pebbles.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Snake Plant (Dracaena Trifasciata)</h3>
                    <p>Dracaena trifasciata, commonly known as the snake plant, is one of the most popular and hardy species of houseplants. Snake plant is an ideal choice for beginner gardeners because it is difficult to kill. This plant is drought-resistant but is susceptible to overwatering which lead to root rot. Only water the plant if the soil feels dry. These plants can go two months between waterings in the winter months. In warmer months, water no more than every two weeks. Snake plants prefer indirect but steady light with some direct sun. They can adapt to full sun conditions and will also survive dimly lit situations.</p>
                    <h3>Zanzibar Gem (Zamioculcas Zamiifolia)</h3>
                    <p>Low-maintenance zz plants are Zamioculcas zamiifolia, characterized by their shiny, wide, oval-shaped leaves that shoot upward and quickly grow in a home indoors. ZZ plants are known for being low-maintenance and easy-to-care-for. All zz plants need is adequate light and a good watering every couple of weeks. However, don't worry too much about forgetting to water your zz plant—these plants grow from rhizomes, which help them to store water under the soil, making them drought-tolerant plants.</p>

                    <h3>Persian Ivy (Hedera Colchica)</h3>
                    <p>Persian ivy, Hedera colchica, is a vigorous, self-clinging evergreen climber bearing dark, leathery green leaves. Mature plants bear spherical flowers in autumn, which are extremely attractive to insects. Hedera colchica can either be used to cover walls and fences or as ground cover. Like all ivies it can tolerate a wide range of conditions and can be trimmed back at any time to keep its size under control. Grow in moist but well-drained soil in sun or shade. <u>Those with sensitive skin should wear gloves when handling ivy as its sap can be an irritant.</u></p>
                    <h3>Lalla Rookh (Hedera Helix)</h3>
                    <p>A fast-growing, hardy, self-clinging evergreen climbing shrub to a height of around 500cm, with mid-green, multi-pointed and deeply-cut foliage. Ideal for growing over an arch or trellis or for hiding an unattractive wall or fence. Hedera are evergreen climbing shrubs clinging by aerial roots. Clusters of small yellow-green flowers are followed by usually black berries. Foliage of flowering shoots is often less deeply lobed than that of the sterile, climbing shoots. Tolerant of a range of soils and conditions but grows best in fertile, humus-rich well-drained alkaline soil in a sheltered spot. <u>Harmful if eaten, skin irritant. Wear gloves and other protective equipment when handling.</u></p>
                    <h3>Japanese Ivy (Hedera Rhombea)</h3>
                    <p>This selection of adult ivy makes a non-running, 30" tall x 18" wide clump, perfect for the sunny or shady garden. Adult ivies are great to add evergreen interest into the often-boring winter shade garden. Each narrow glossy blue-green leaf is surrounded by a dramatic, creamy white border. In autumn, the clumps are topped with cute green flower spikes resembling alien antennae. When the soil is dry, add water until excess water drains from the pot. Light plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy growth and the shape of japanese ivy. It grows well in bright light, and thus it is advised to provide it with indirect light for 6-8 hours every day. Avoid direct exposure to strong light as it can burn the leaves, especially in summer.</p>
